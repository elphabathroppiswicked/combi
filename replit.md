# StepGallery - Chrome Extension Project

## Overview
StepGallery is a professional Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that provides advanced image gallery detection, intelligent pagination, multi-format export capabilities, and batch downloading. This is a production-ready extension suitable for government and enterprise distribution.

**Version:** 3.0.0  
**Type:** Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)  
**Status:** Production-Ready

## Project Structure

This project contains:
1. **Chrome Extension Files** - The actual extension that runs in Chrome
2. **Demo Website** - Documentation and testing interface (for Replit)
3. **Test Gallery Page** - Sample gallery for testing the extension

### Key Directories
- `/icons/` - Extension icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
- `/lib/` - Self-hosted libraries (PapaParse, SheetJS)
- `/src/` - Extension source code
  - `/src/background/` - Service worker modules
  - `/src/content/` - Content script modules (original)
  - `/src/shared/` - Shared utilities
  - `/src/ui/dashboard/` - Side panel interface
- `/offscreen/` - Offscreen worker for exports
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `background.js` - Service worker entry point
- `content-bundle.js` - Bundled content script

### Demo Files (Replit-specific)
- `index.html` - Documentation and installation guide
- `test-gallery.html` - Test page with sample image gallery
- `server.py` - Simple HTTP server for serving demo pages

## How to Use in Replit

The Replit environment serves a **demo website** that provides:
- Installation instructions for the Chrome extension
- Documentation of features
- A test gallery page for testing the extension after installation

### Accessing the Demo
The server is running on port 5000 and serves:
- **Main page:** `/` or `/index.html` - Installation guide
- **Test gallery:** `/test-gallery.html` - Sample gallery for testing

## Installing the Extension in Chrome

Since Chrome extensions cannot run directly in Replit's preview, users must:

1. **Download the Extension Files**

2. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing `manifest.json`
   
3. **Test the Extension**
   - Open the test gallery page from this Replit
   - Click the StepGallery icon in Chrome toolbar
   - Side panel opens with gallery detection
   - Test pagination, export, and download features

## Architecture

### Chrome Extension Architecture
- **Service Worker** (`background.js`) - Background processing
- **Content Scripts** (`content-bundle.js`) - Page interaction
